# Online Payments Fraud Detection

This is a Streamlit application that uses a machine learning model to detect online payment fraud.

## About the Project

The project aims to build a fraud detection system for online payments. The application takes user input for various transaction details and uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

## Features

- User-friendly Streamlit interface to input transaction details
- Leverages a pre-trained Decision Tree Classifier model for fraud detection
- Displays the prediction result as "Flagged as Fraud" or "Flagged as Not Fraud"

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install the required dependencies:
